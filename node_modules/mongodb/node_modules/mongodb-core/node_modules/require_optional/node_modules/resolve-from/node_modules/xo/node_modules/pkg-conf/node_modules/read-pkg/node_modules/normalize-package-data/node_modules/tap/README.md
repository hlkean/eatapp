# node-tap

A <abbr title="Test Anything Protocol">TAP</abbr> test framework for
Node.js.

It includes a command line test runner for consuming TAP-generating
test scripts, and a JavaScript framework for writing such scripts.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isaacs/node-tap/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/isaacs/node-tap?branch=master)

## USAGE

Write your tests in JavaScript

```javascript
var tap = require('tap')

// you can test stuff just using the top level object.
// no suites or subtests required.

tap.equal(1, 1, 'check if numbers still work')
tap.notEqual(1, 2, '1 should not equal 2')

// also you can group things into sub-tests.
// Sub-tests will be run in sequential order always,
// so they're great for async things.

tap.test('first stuff', function (t) {
  t.ok(true, 'true is ok')
  t.similar({a: [1,2,3]}, {a: [1,2,3]})
  // call t.end() when you're done
  t.end()
})

// If you have a bunch of setup stuff that MUST work or else
// the rest of the tests are not worth running, then you can
// pass `{ bail: true }` to make it bail out on failure.

tap.test('must succeed or all is lost', { bail: true }, function (t) {
  db = new DataBorscht()
  t.ok(db, 'borscht setup must succeed')
  t.end()
})

// You can also bail out based on specific conditions, or with a
// different error message of your choosing.
tap.test('must mostly succeed or all is lost', function (t) {
  db = new DataBorscht()

  t.ok(db, 'borscht setup')
  if (!db) {
    t.bailout('the borscht is lost.  I cannot continue.')
    return
  }

  t.ok(db.connection, 'db must have connection')
  t.ok(db.username, 'db must have username')
  t.equal(db.color, 'red', 'borscht should be red')
  if (!t.passing())
    t.bailout('something weird with the data borscht.')

  t.end()
})

// you can specify a 'plan' if you know how many
// tests there will be in advance. Handy when
// order is irrelevant and things happen in parallel.

// Note that the function name is used if no name is provided!
tap.test(function planned (t) {
  t.plan(2)
  setTimeout(function () {
    t.ok(true, 'a timeout')
  })
  setTimeout(function () {
    t.ok(true, 'b timeout')
  })
})

// you can do `var test = require('tap').test` if you like
// it's pre-bound to the root tap object.

var test = require('tap').test

// subtests can have subtests
test(function parent (t) {
  t.test(function child (tt) {
    tt.throws(function () {
      throw new Error('fooblz')
    }, {
      message: 'fooblz'
    }, 'throw a fooblz')

    // throws also uses function name if no name provided
    tt.throws(function throw_whatever () { throw 1 })

    tt.end()
  })

  t.end()
})

// thrown errors just fail the current test, so you can
// also use your own assert library if you like.
// Of course, this means it won't be able to print out the
// number of passing asserts, since passes will be silent.

test('my favorite assert lib', function (t) {
  var assert = require('assert')
  assert.ok(true, 'true is ok')
  assert.equal(1, 1, 'math works')

  // Since it can't read the plan, using a custom assert lib
  // means that you MUST use t.end()
  t.end()
})

// You can mark tests as 'todo' either using a conf object,
// or simply by omitting the callback.
test('solve halting problem')
test('prove p=np', { todo: true }, function (t) {
  // i guess stuff goes here
  t.fail('traveling salesmen must pack their own bags')
  t.end()
})

// Prefer mocha/rspec/lab style global objects?
// Got you covered.  This is a little experimental,
// patches definitely welcome.
tap.mochaGlobals()
describe('suite ride bro', function () {
  it('should have a wheel', function () {
    assert.ok(thingie.wheel, 'wheel')
  })
  it('can happen async', function (done) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      assert.ok('ok')
      done()
    })
  })
})

// Read on for a complete list of asserts, methods, etc.
```

You can run tests using the `tap` executable.  Put this in your
package.json file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "tap test/*.js"
  }
}
```

and then you can run `npm test` to run your test scripts.

Command line behavior and flags:

```
$ tap -h
Usage:
  tap [options] <files>

Executes all the files and interprets their output as TAP
formatted test result data.

To parse TAP data from stdin, specify "-" as a filename.

Short options are parsed gnu-style, so for example '-bCRspec' would be
equivalent to '--bail --no-color --reporter=spec'

Options:

  -c --color                  Use colors (Default for TTY)

  -C --no-color               Do not use colors (Default for non-TTY)

  -b --bail                   Bail out on first failure

  -B --no-bail                Do not bail out on first failure (Default)

  -R<type> --reporter=<type>  Use the specified reporter.  Defaults to
                              'classic' when colors are in use, or 'tap'
                              when colors are disabled.

                              Available reporters:
                              classic doc dot dump html htmlcov json
                              jsoncov jsonstream landing list markdown
                              min nyan progress silent spec tap xunit

  -s<file> --save=<file>      If <file> exists, then it should be a line-
                              delimited list of test files to run.  If
                              <file> is not present, then all command-line
                              positional arguments are run.

                              After the set of test files are run, any
                              failed test files are written back to the
                              save file.

                              This way, repeated runs with -s<file> will
                              re-run failures until all the failures are
                              passing, and then once again run all tests.

                              It's a good idea to .gitignore the file
                              used for this purpose, as it will churn a
                              lot.

  --coverage --cov            Capture coverage information using 'nyc'

                              If a COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN environment
                              variable is set, then coverage is
                              captured by default and sent to the
                              coveralls.io service. If a CODECOV_TOKEN
                              environment variable is set, then coverage is
                              captured by default and sent to the
                              codecov.io service.

  --no-coverage --no-cov      Do not capture coverage information.
                              Note that if nyc is already loaded, then
                              the coverage info will still be captured.

  --coverage-report=<type>    Output coverage information using the
                              specified istanbul/nyc reporter type.

                              Default is 'text' when running on the
                              command line, or 'text-lcov' when piping
                              to coveralls or codecov.

                              If 'lcov' is used, then the report will
                              be opened in a web browser after running.

                              This can be run on its own at any time
                              after a test run that included coverage.

  -t<n> --timeout=<n>         Time out test files after <n> seconds.
                              Defaults to 30, or the value of the
                              TAP_TIMEOUT environment variable.

  -h --help                   print this thing you're looking at

  -v --version                show the version of this program

  -gc --expose-gc             Expose the gc() function to Node tests

  --debug                     Run JavaScript tests with node --debug

  --debug-brk                 Run JavaScript tests with node --debug-brk

  --harmony                   Enable all Harmony flags in JavaScript tests

  --strict                    Run JS tests in 'use strict' mode

  --                          Stop parsing flags, and treat any additional
                              command line arguments as filenames.
```

## Coverage

This module uses [nyc](http://npm.im/nyc) to track code coverage, even
across subprocess boundaries.  It is included by default, and there's
nothing you need to do but enable it.  Adding coverage *will* make
your tests run slightly slower, but that's to be expected.

To generate coverage information, run your tests with the `--cov`
argument.

To specify a report format, you can use `--coverage-report=<type>`.
The default type is `text`, which produces a pretty text-only table on
the terminal.  If you specify `--coverage-report=lcov`, then tap will
attempt to open a web browser to view the report after the test run.

If you use this a lot, you may want to add `coverage` and
`.nyc_output` to your `.gitignore` and/or `.npmignore` files.

### Travis-CI and Coveralls.io/CodeCov.io Integration

You can very easily take advantage of continuous test coverage reports
by using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) and
[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io).

1. Enable Travis-CI by signing up, enabling tests on your repo, and
   adding a `.travis.yml` file to your repo.  You can use [this
   module's .travis.yml file as an
   example](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap/blob/master/.travis.yml)
2. Enable Coveralls.io or CodeCov.io by signing up, and adding the
   repo.  Note the repo API token.
3. Back at Travis-CI, add a private environment variable.  The name of
   the environment variable is `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` for Coveralls,
   or `CODECOV_TOKEN` for CodeCov.io, and the value is the token you
   got from Coveralls or CodeCov.
4. When that token is set in the environment variable, `tap` will
   automatically generate coverage information and send it to the
   appropriate place.

## API

### tap = require('tap')

The root `tap` object is an instance of the Test class with a few
slight modifications.

1. The `tearDown()`, `plan()`, and `test()` methods are pre-bound onto
   the root object, so that you don't have to call them as methods.
2. By default, it pipes to stdout, so running a test directly just
   dumps the TAP data for inspection.  (You can of course
   `tap.unpipe(process.stdout)` if you want to direct it elsewhere.)
3. Various other things are hung onto it for convenience, since it is
   the main package export.
4. The test ends automatically when `process.on('exit')` fires, so
   there is no need to call `tap.end()` explicitly.
5. Adding a `tearDown` function triggers `autoend` behavior.
   Otherwise, the `end` would potentially never arrive, if for example
   `tearDown` is used to close a server or cancel some long-running
   process, because `process.on('exit')` would never fire of its own
   accord.

### tap.synonyms

### tap.mochaGlobals()

Method that injects `describe()` and `it()` into the global
environment for mocha-like BDD style test definition.

This feature is incomplete, experimental, and may change drastically
in the future.  Feedback is welcome.
