# node-tap

A TAP test framework for Node.js.

This is a mix-and-match set of utilities that you can use to write test
harnesses and frameworks that communicate with one another using the
Test Anything Protocol.

It is also a test runner for consuming TAP-generating test scripts,
and a framework for writing such scripts.

## USAGE

Write your tests in JavaScript

```javascript
var tap = require('tap')

// you can test stuff just using the top level object.
// no suites or subtests required.

tap.equal(1, 1, 'check if numbers still work')
tap.notEqual(1, 2, '1 should not equal 2')

// also you can group things into sub-tests.
// Sub-tests will be run in sequential order always,
// so they're great for async things.

tap.test('first stuff', function (t) {
  t.ok(true, 'true is ok')
  t.similar({a: [1,2,3]}, {a: [1,2,3]})
  // call t.end() when you're done
  t.end()
})
