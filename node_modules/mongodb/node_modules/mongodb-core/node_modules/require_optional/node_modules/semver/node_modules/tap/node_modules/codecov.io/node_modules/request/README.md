# Request — Simplified HTTP client

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/request.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/request/)

## Super simple to use

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

```javascript
var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.
  }
})
```

## Streaming

You can stream any response to a file stream.

```javascript
request('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

You can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).

```javascript
fs.createReadStream('file.json').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/obj.json'))
```

Request can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.

```javascript
request.get('http://google.com/img.png').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

Now let’s get fancy.

```javascript
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    if (req.method === 'PUT') {
      req.pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/doodle.png'))
    } else if (req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'HEAD') {
      request.get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
    }
  }
})
```

You can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don't really care about security, you can do:

```javascript
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    var x = request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
    req.pipe(x)
    x.pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

And since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)

```javascript
req.pipe(request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')).pipe(resp)
```

Also, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.

```javascript
var r = request.defaults({'proxy':'http://localproxy.com'})

http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    r.get('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

You can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.

## Proxies

If you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent
redirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.

If your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then
request will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and
then use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.

That is, first it will make a request like:

```
HTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80
Host: proxy-server.com
User-Agent: whatever user agent you specify
```

and then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`
on port `80`, and return a response that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

At this point, the connection is left open, and the client is
communicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.

See (the wikipedia page on HTTP
Tunneling)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel] for more
information.

By default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a
standard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`
section of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to
the endpoint.

For example, it will make a single request that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url
Host: proxy-server.com
Other-Headers: all go here

request body or whatever
```

Because a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security
or other features, it is generally simpler to go with a
straightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like
to force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.

If you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the
`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.

By default, this set is:

```
accept
accept-charset
accept-encoding
accept-language
accept-ranges
cache-control
content-encoding
content-language
content-length
content-location
content-md5
content-range
content-type
connection
date
expect
max-forwards
pragma
proxy-authorization
referer
te
transfer-encoding
user-agent
via
```

Note that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`
header is *never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy
server.  All other headers are sent as-is over the established
connection.

## UNIX Socket 

`request` supports the `unix://` protocol for all requests. The path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system. 

HTTP paths are extracted from the supplied URL by testing each level of the full URL against net.connect for a socket response.

Thus the following request will GET `/httppath` from the HTTP server listening on `/tmp/unix.socket`

```javascript
request.get('unix://tmp/unix.socket/httppath')
```

## Forms

`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.

URL-encoded forms are simple.

```javascript
request.post('http://service.com/upload', {form:{key:'value'}})
// or
request.post('http://service.com/upload').form({key:'value'})
```

For `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). You don’t need to worry about piping the form object or setting the headers, `request` will handle that for you.

```javascript
var r = request.post('http://service.com/upload', function optionalCallback (err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('upload failed:', err);
  }
  console.log('Upload successful!  Server responded with:', body);
})
var form = r.form()
form.append('my_field', 'my_value')
form.append('my_buffer', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]))
form.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'doodle.png')))
form.append('remote_file', request('http://google.com/doodle.png'))

// Just like always, `r` is a writable stream, and can be used as such (you have until nextTick to pipe it, etc.)
// Alternatively, you can provide a callback (that's what this example does — see `optionalCallback` above).
```

## HTTP Authentication

```javascript
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth('username', 'password', false);
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'user': 'username',
    'pass': 'password',
    'sendImmediately': false
  }
});
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth(null, null, true, 'bearerToken');
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'bearer': 'bearerToken'
  }
});
```

If passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  The method form takes parameters `auth(username, password, sendImmediately)`.

`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic authentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then `request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a `401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header indicating the required authentication
