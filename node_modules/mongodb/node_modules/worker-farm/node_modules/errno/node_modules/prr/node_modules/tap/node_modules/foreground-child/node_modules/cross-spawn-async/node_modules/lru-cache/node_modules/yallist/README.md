# yallist

Yet Another Linked List

There are many doubly-linked list implementations like it, but this
one is mine.

For when an array would be too big, and a Map can't be iterated in
reverse order.

## basic usage

```javascript
var yallist = require('yallist')
var myList = yallist.create([1, 2, 3])
myList.push('foo')
myList.unshift('bar')
// of course pop() and shift() are there, too
console.log(myList.toArray()) // ['bar', 1, 2, 3, 'foo']
myList.forEach(function (k) {
  // walk the list head to tail
})
myList.forEachReverse(function (k, index, list) {
  // walk the list tail to head
})
var myDoubledList = myList.map(function (k) {
  return k + k
})
// now myDoubledList contains ['barbar', 2, 4, 6, 'foofoo']
// mapReverse is also a thing
var myDoubledListReverse = myList.mapReverse(function (k) {
  return k + k
}) // ['foofoo', 6, 4, 2, 'barbar']

var reduced = myList.reduce(function (set, entry) {
  set += entry
  return set
}, 'start')
console.log(reduced) // 'startfoo123bar'
```

## api

The whole API is considered "public".

Functions with the same name as an Array method work more or less the
same way.

There's reverse versions of most things because that's the point.
