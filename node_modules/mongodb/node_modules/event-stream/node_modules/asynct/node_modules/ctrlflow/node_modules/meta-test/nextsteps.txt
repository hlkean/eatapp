UPDATE:

got node version option in meta-test

remap not compatible (currently) with 0.2.x

got weird infinite loops with 0.2.0 in meta-test/test/asynct.node.js


ok, wrapper for remapper: NpmRemapper

give it orders like {package@version1: package@version2}
if changes this into
if it detects you loading:
  $NPM_PATH/package/version1/...
it returns 
  $NPM_PATH/package/version2/...
instead.

there may be different files in different versions, but it should only hook the first one, and the rest should be fine.

..or intercept package.* and redirect to $NPM_PATH/package/version/package that should work...

will need a bunch of packages with plenty of dependencies to test this on. (I know, i'll just make some examples and publish them to use in my tests)

...what about when testing different versions of the same package... will need to set it to ignore particular paths...

package\tests etc...

that should get remap working in 0.3.X ... rewrite to compatible with 0.2.0 (might not be that hard...)



remap is no
