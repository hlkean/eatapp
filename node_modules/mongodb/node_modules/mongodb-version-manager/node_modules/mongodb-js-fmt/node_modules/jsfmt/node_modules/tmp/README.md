A simple temporary file and directory creator for [node.js.][1]

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/raszi/node-tmp.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/raszi/node-tmp)

## About

This is a [widely used library][2] to create temporary files and directories
in a [node.js][1] environment.

Tmp offers both an asynchronous and a synchronous API. For all API calls, all
the parameters are optional.

Tmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates,
a six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that much
entropy left on your system, Tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.

You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or
not, and the destination directory can also be set.

## How to install

```bash
npm install tmp
```

## Usage

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp');

tmp.file(function _tempFil
