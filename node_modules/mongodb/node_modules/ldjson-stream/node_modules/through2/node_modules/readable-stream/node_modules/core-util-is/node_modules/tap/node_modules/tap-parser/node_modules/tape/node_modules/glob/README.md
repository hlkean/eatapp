# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Attention: node-glob users!

The API has changed dramatically between 2.x and 3.x. This library is
now 100% JavaScript, and the integer flags have been replaced with an
options object.

Also, there's an event emitter class, proper tests, and all the other
things you've come to expect from node modules.

And best of all, no compilation!

## Usage

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Features

Please see the [minimatch
documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more details.

Supports these glob features:

* Brace Expansion
* Extended glob matching
* "Globstar" `**` matching

See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

## glob(pattern, [options], cb)

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function}
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform an asynchronous glob search.

## glob.sync(pattern, [options])

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform a synchronous glob search.

## Class: glob.Glob

Create a Glob object by instanting the `glob.Glob` class.

```javascript
var Glob = require("glob").Glob
var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
```

It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
immediately.

### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])

* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
  * `err` {
